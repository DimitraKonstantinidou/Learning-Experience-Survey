# Learning-Experience-Survey

This project is a user feedback app created during a Vue.js course on Udemy. Users can fill out a survey to rate their learning experience, and their feedback is displayed on the app. The app uses Firebase to store and retrieve the data and includes error handling to manage issues with data fetching or submission.
